                "Early blight is a common disease of potato caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. It is usually more severe in warm, wet weather. The disease primarily affects leaves and stems, but under favorable weather conditions, it can also affect tubers. Early blight is usually more severe in fields where potatoes are grown in successive years.",
                "Symptoms: Small, brown spots with a target-like appearance develop on the older leaves. The spots may enlarge and the centers may turn gray. The disease can cause significant defoliation, which can reduce yield and quality of the tubers. The fungus can also infect the stems and tubers, causing dark, sunken lesions.",
                "The fungus overwinters in infected plant debris and can be spread by wind, rain, and irrigation water. The disease is favored by warm, wet weather and can be more severe in fields where potatoes are grown in successive years."

                "Late blight is a common disease of potato caused by the oomycete Phytophthora infestans. The disease is most severe in cool, wet weather and can cause significant yield losses if left untreated.",
                "Symptoms: Large, water-soaked lesions develop on the leaves, stems, and tubers. The lesions may be dark brown to black in color and may have a greasy appearance. Severe infections can cause defoliation, which can reduce yield and quality of the tubers.",
