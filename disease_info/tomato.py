                "The bacterium overwinters in infected plant debris and can be spread by wind, rain, and irrigation water. The disease is favored by warm, wet weather and can be more severe in fields where tomatoes are grown in successive years."

The disease primarily affects leaves and stems, but under favorable weather conditions, it can also affect fruit. Early blight is usually more severe in fields where tomatoes are grown in successive years.",
