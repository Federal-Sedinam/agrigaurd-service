                "Cercospora leaf spot, also known as gray leaf spot, is a common fungal disease of corn caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis. The disease is most severe in warm, humid weather and can cause significant yield losses if left untreated.",
                "Symptoms: Small, circular to oval lesions with gray centers and dark brown to purple margins develop on the leaves. The lesions may coalesce to form larger spots, which can cause significant defoliation. Severe infections can also affect the husks and stalks of the plant.",
                "The fungus overwinters in infected crop debris and can be spread by wind, rain, and irrigation water. The disease is favored by warm, humid weather and can be more severe in fields where corn is grown in successive years."
