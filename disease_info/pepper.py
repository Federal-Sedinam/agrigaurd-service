                "Bacterial spot is a common disease of pepper caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. The disease is most severe in warm, wet weather and can cause significant yield losses if left untreated.",
                "Symptoms: Small, water-soaked lesions develop on the leaves, stems, and fruit. The lesions may be dark brown to black in color and may have a greasy appearance. Severe infections can cause defoliation, which can reduce yield and quality of the fruit.",
                "The bacterium overwinters in infected plant debris and can be spread by wind, rain, and irrigation water. The disease is favored by warm, wet weather and can be more severe in fields where peppers are grown in successive years."
